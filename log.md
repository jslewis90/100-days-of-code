# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I started my cold turkey redesign of my website to switch from WordPress to Laravel.

**Thoughts** I've put off redesigning my website too long. It will be redesigned both in terms of database structure (backend) and the front-end. For today, I setup the home page to display external download links to some game mods I made.
